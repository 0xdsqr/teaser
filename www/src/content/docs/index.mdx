Composable coming soon landing page components. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**Install once. Use everywhere. Zero dependencies.**

## The Problem

Coming soon pages require repetitive boilerplate:

- Email input validation
- Form state management
- Success/error UI states
- Responsive animations
- Theme consistency

Building from scratch every time wastes time and introduces inconsistency.

## The Solution

Teaser provides battle-tested, composable components:

- **Self-contained** - Each component works independently
- **Composable** - Combine them exactly how you need
- **Unstyled** - Use with any design system
- **Themeable** - CSS variables for instant customization
- **No dependencies** - Pure React + Tailwind

## Quick Start

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import {
  Teaser,
  TeaserHeader,
  TeaserTitle,
  TeaserDescription,
  TeaserIcon,
  TeaserForm,
  TeaserInput,
  TeaserButton,
  TeaserSuccess,
  TeaserSuccessIcon,
  TeaserSuccessMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/teaser";

export default function ComingSoon() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <Teaser>
        <TeaserIcon animated>🚀</TeaserIcon>

        <TeaserHeader>
          <TeaserTitle>Something Amazing</TeaserTitle>
          <TeaserDescription>
            We're building something cool. Be the first to know.
          </TeaserDescription>
        </TeaserHeader>

        {!submitted ? (
          <TeaserForm onEmailSubmit={(email) => setSubmitted(true)}>
            <TeaserInput placeholder="you@example.com" />
            <TeaserButton>Notify Me</TeaserButton>
          </TeaserForm>
        ) : (
          <TeaserSuccess>
            <TeaserSuccessIcon>✨</TeaserSuccessIcon>
            <TeaserSuccessMessage>Thanks for signing up!</TeaserSuccessMessage>
          </TeaserSuccess>
        )}
      </Teaser>
    </main>
  );
}
```

That's it. Deploy it.
